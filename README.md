# mustreads
Hi , this is book reviewing website which uses goodreads api to show the rating of the book on goodreads + it also shows the rating and reviews on itself .

1. it uses flask at the backend , and uses postgres sql to save the book data and its reviews
2. on the front , it uses html , css , bootstrap, javascript.
3. also it has added feature like showing the top 5 rated books of different time periods which i felt was missing on goodreads.
